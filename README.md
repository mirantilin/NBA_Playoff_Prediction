# NBA_Playoff_Prediction
The goal of this project is to predict playoff success of NBA teams given data from their regular seasons using teams from 1987-1988 season until present day. 
We tested upwards of 42 different attributes on various models like decision trees, logistic regression, and multilayer perceptrons among others to see which contributed to create the most accurate model.
